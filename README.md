# Musipedia

Musipedia is a website that is built using React and Redux, styled with Tailwind CSS. It is a clone of the Genius website and Spotify, where users can play songs, get information about the song or artist, and discover new music.

## Features

Musipedia currently has the following features:

- Play songs 
- Get information about the song or artist 

However, there are some features that still need to be added:

- Search component
- "Play something" component 
- Explore page 
- Album page 
- UI upgrades
